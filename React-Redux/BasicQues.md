1. What is redux ? How to use please explain.

Ans->> Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps, most commonly used with libraries like React or Angular for managing the application state. It provides a centralized store that holds the entire state of your application, making it easier to manage and update.

Key Concepts of Redux:
1.Store: The single source of truth. It holds the state of your application.

2.Actions: Plain JavaScript objects that represent an intention to change the state. They are the only way to get data into the store.

3.Reducers: Functions that specify how the application's state changes in response to actions sent to the store. They are pure functions without side effects.

4.Dispatch: The method used to send actions to the store.

5.Subscribe: A method that registers callbacks to be called any time an action has been dispatched, so that you can update the UI in response to the current state of the application.

How to Use Redux:
Hereâ€™s a step-by-step explanation of how to use Redux with React:

Step 1: Install Redux and React-Redux
First, you need to install Redux and React-Redux (which provides React bindings for Redux):

npm install redux react-redux


Step 2: Define Actions
Actions are plain JavaScript objects that describe what happened. For example:


// actions.js

export const increment = () => ({
  type: 'INCREMENT'
});


export const decrement = () => ({
  type: 'DECREMENT'
});


Step 3: Create Reducers

Reducers specify how the application's state changes in response to actions:


// reducers.js

const initialState = {
  count: 0
};

const counterReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {

    case 'INCREMENT':

      return { ...state, count: state.count + 1 };

    case 'DECREMENT':
      return { ...state, count: state.count - 1 };

    default:
      return state;
  }
};

export default counterReducer;



Step 4: Create a Redux Store


// store.js

import { createStore } from 'redux';

import counterReducer from './reducers';

const store = createStore(counterReducer);

export default store;


// store.js


import { createStore } from 'redux';

import counterReducer from './reducers';

const store = createStore(counterReducer);

export default store;


Step 5: Provide the Redux Store to Your React Components
Wrap your root component with Provider from react-redux to make the Redux store available to all your components:



// index.js or App.js

import React from 'react';

import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

import { Provider } from 'react-redux';

import store from './store';

import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(

  <Provider store={store}>

    <App />

  </Provider>,

  document.getElementById('root')
);



Step 6: Connect Redux State to React Components
Use connect from react-redux to connect your React components to the Redux store:


// App.js

import React from 'react';

import { connect } from 'react-redux';

import { increment, decrement } from './actions';

const App = ({ count, increment, decrement }) => (

  <div>
    <h2>Count: {count}</h2>

    <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>

    <button onClick={decrement}>Decrement</button>

  </div>
);


const mapStateToProps = state => ({

  count: state.count

});

export default connect(mapStateToProps, { increment, decrement })(App);

What is thunk? Why we use despite of react redux. And it's advantages. please explain 

Ans.->>
    In the context of React and Redux, a "thunk" refers to a function that delays the execution of code. Redux Thunk is a middleware for Redux that enables the use of asynchronous logic in your Redux actions.

    We use thunks alongside React Redux when we need to handle asynchronous operations, like fetching data from an API, before updating the Redux store. Thunks allow us to dispatch actions with side effects, such as API calls, and handle them in a more organized manner.


    Advantages of using thunks in React Redux include:

    1.Asynchronous Operations: Thunks enable the handling of asynchronous actions, making it possible to manage side effects like data fetching without blocking the UI.

    2.Simplified Action Creators: Thunks provide a way to encapsulate complex logic within action creators, improving code organization and maintainability.

    3.Middleware Integration: Redux Thunk seamlessly integrates with Redux middleware, allowing for a smooth workflow when dealing with asynchronous tasks.

    4.Conditional Dispatch: Thunks allow for conditional dispatching of actions based on certain conditions, providing flexibility in managing the flow of actions.

Overall, Redux Thunk is a powerful tool that enhances the capabilities of Redux by facilitating the handling of asynchronous operations in a React application.

   Eg.


              // With Redux Thunk Middleware

            import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';
            import thunk from 'redux-thunk';

            // action types
            const INCREMENT = 'INCREMENT';

            // action creator
            const increment = () => ({ type: INCREMENT });

            // async action creator with Redux Thunk
            const incrementAsync = () => {
              return (dispatch) => {
                setTimeout(() => {
                  dispatch(increment());
                }, 1000);
              };
            };

            // reducer
            const counterReducer = (state = 0, action) => {
              switch (action.type) {
                case INCREMENT:
                  return state + 1;
                default:
                  return state;
              }
            };

            // store with Redux Thunk middleware
            const store = createStore(counterReducer, applyMiddleware(thunk));

            // dispatch an asynchronous action
            store.dispatch(incrementAsync());

            
            In this example, we added Redux Thunk middleware using applyMiddleware(thunk) when creating the store. Now, the incrementAsync action creator can perform asynchronous operations before dispatching the INCREMENT action. This is the power of middleware in Redux, and Redux Thunk specifically enables handling asynchronous logic within action creators.
